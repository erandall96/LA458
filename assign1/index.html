  Hello, my name is Emily R. Randall and I am an undergraduate student at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. 
  In this course I hope to learn more about wed development and integrate them into ArcGIS. I am also excited to learn more about coding altogether. I have never coded, even though it seems a bit difficult, I think it is an important skill to have.
